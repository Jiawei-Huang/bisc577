Assignment 2. Mapping and variation.

Because there are delays in getting the cluster environment set up,
this assignment should be done in pairs, with at least one person in
each pair having access to the HPC.   Both people should e-mail the
snakemake file used to run the analysis, and a word or pdf doc of the
answers to questions below.  There may be issues getting your
environment set up correctly on the HPC, so please do not hesitate to
send me questions about this. 


This will involve a little SNV detection, SV detection, and de novo
assembly looking at Drosophila. The data is all local, and there will
be less guidance for this project than the last.

There are two sets of reads. If you do the assignment with a snakemake file using wildcards,
it will be less work in the long run. 


You will need to do this on the HPC cluster.  First log onto
hpc-cmb.usc.edu, with your normal login credentials.

Then you will need to start an interactive session on a node using
UGE.

> salloc -c 8 --mem=24000 --time=24:00:00 --partition=cmb

This will start a session on a node with 24G of ram, and 8 cores, and
you will stay logged on for up to 24 hours.


Data:
- The drosophila reference is here:

/home/cmb-16/mjc/bisc577a/DrosophilaData/Genome/dm6.fa

- Reads are from two samples, one drosophila strain from Italy (SRR5762776),
and another from Sweden (SRR6765736)

You should make a directory to run this assignment on the hpc cluster,
NOT in your home directory.  Your home directory will run out of
space.

> mkdir Assignment2_2
> cd Assignment2_2

Now symlink the read files into this directory:
ln -s /home/cmb-16/mjc/bisc577a/DrosophilaData/Reads_CastellanaGrotte_Italy/SRR5762776_1.fastq .
ln -s /home/cmb-16/mjc/bisc577a/DrosophilaData/Reads_CastellanaGrotte_Italy/SRR5762776_2.fastq .

ln -s /home/cmb-16/mjc/bisc577a/DrosophilaData/Reads_Stockholm_Sweden/SRR6765736_1.fastq
. 
ln -s /home/cmb-16/mjc/bisc577a/DrosophilaData/Reads_Stockholm_Sweden/SRR6765736_2.fastq .



There is a snakemake file here to get you started:

/home/cmb-16/mjc/bisc577a/Assignment.2.2.snakefile

which requires the file:

/home/cmb-16/mjc/bisc577a/config.sh

Copy the snakefile and config.sh to the directory where you have symlinked the files.


Assignment.2.2.snakefile. To run it, do:

source /home/cmb-16/mjc/shared/virtualenvs/python3/bin/activate
snakemake -p -s Assignment.2.2.snakefile

Grading is out of a total of 100 points. Each step should have one or
more associated rules in a snakefile.



Steps.
1. (10 points) Add a rule to map reads from the two species.

You need to run bwa mem, with the flag set to add a read group. This
step is provided in the snakefile.

2. (10 points) Add a rule and Call variants using freebayes. There is an installation of
freebayes here:

/home/cmb-16/mjc/shared/bin/freebayes

If you are running this outside of writing your snakemake file, you
need to source a config file that sets up your environment:

> source /home/cmb-16/mjc/bisc577a/config.sh

*Note* This removes python3 from your environment.  To go back to
 python 3 to use snakemake, reactivate the python 3 virtualenv:

source /home/cmb-16/mjc/shared/virtualenvs/python3/bin/activate


3. (20 points)  Compare the variants between the two files. You will need to become
familiar with bedtools and either grep or vcftools.
https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2

It is installed on the cluster here:
/home/cmb-16/mjc/shared/bin/bedtools

For the freebayes calls:
  - How many SNV calls are there per drosophila sample?  
  - How many homozygous SNVs? 
  - How many heterozygous SNVs?
  - How many SNVs are shared between the two species?
  - Compute the SNV density in 20kbp bins, plot a histogram of SNV
    density.


4. (10 points) Call structural variants using wham;

The command to call this on one genome is:

> /home/cmb-16/mjc/shared/software_packages/wham/bin/whamg -f SRR6765736.bam -a /home/cmb-16/mjc/bisc577a/DrosophilaData/Genome/dm6.fa > SRR6765736.wham.vcf


Plot a distribution of the lengths of structural variants in each species. Hint: the field SVLEN in the VCF file gives the expected length of the SV. 

Extra (fun, no extra credit): is there an elevated SNV rate near SVs?

6. (10 points) Assemble each genome using minia

The command for one of the genomes is:


> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/usc/gnu/gcc/5.3.0/lib64

> /home/cmb-16/mjc/shared/bin/minia

You'll have to read output to determine what options to use.

. Now answer: how much of the genome is assembled into contigs greater than 2kbp? There will be a file: 
SRR5762776-contigs.fa

If you create a index on this file using:
>samtools faidx SRR5762776-contigs.fa

you can parse the output .fai file and compute this statistic.

You'll have to read output to determine what options to use.

7. (20 points)  Now answer: how much of the genome is assembled into contigs greater than 2kbp? There will be a file: 
SRR5762776-contigs.fa

If you create a index on this file using:
samtools faidx SRR5762776-contigs.fa, you can parse the output .fai file and compute this statistic.

8. (20 points) Create another rule to assemble with a different k-mer. Reassemble,
and compute the N50 of the two assemblies.
